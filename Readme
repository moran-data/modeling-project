The goal of our project is to use linear regression to show how the effects of our independent variables such as (bedrooms, floors, zipcode ...), 
affect our dependent variable which is the price in Seattle, Washington.

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

Our dataset contains 21,597 Observations, 21 variables and from May 2014/May 2015

DAY 1:
We will be performing explortatory data analysis on our dataset, discovering patterns, spot anomalies and graphical representations.

DAY 2:
We will be cleaning our dataset, removing typos, checking for correct typos, column names, looking for duplicates and null values. 
We will also be standardizing the units from square feet to square meter, also dropping irrelevant columns that would have no effects on our datasets.

DAY 3:
Tranforming the data would begin, we would be scaling numerical features and encoding our categorical features.

DAY 4: 
Modeling, splitting data using  X Y Split and performing OLS on our test and train data.
